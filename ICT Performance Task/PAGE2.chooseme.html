			<h2> BEACH BUM FOOD PARK </h2>
			<hr>
			<p>Beach Bum is the very first food park in San Juan. Food parks have been all the rage in Manila in recent years and they've proliferated in other parts of the country as well, including La Union. Places like Beach Bum BBQ tend to be the most successful stalls at food parks, simply because Filipinos love snacking on grilled food while drinking. Pictured below are sticks of isaw, a popular Filipino street food made with barbecued chicken or pork intestines. </p>

			<h2> COFFEE LIBRARY </h2>
			<hr>
			<p> The Coffee Library also lets you bring home the authenticity of the coffee that they offer so that you can share it with your friends and family! They have packed Single Origin coffee beans from different parts of the world–Columbia, Nicaragua, and also our very own Bukidnon and Benguet coffee.Adding to all these mouthwatering goods is the chill ambiance that The Coffee Library offers. It’s actually a two-story structure made from an old container van, giving it a bit of a rustic vibe. The glass walls also make it such a light and relaxing place to read the books that customers can borrow–it is a library after all.</p>

			<h2> TAGPUAN </h2>
			<hr>
			<p>Tagpuan sa San Juan is a small food place located along Urbiztondo Road of the surfing town. It’s like a common eatery or also known as “carinderia” in our language. But what does Tagpuan sa San Juan cultivates is not just the good food they serve, but also the concept of sharing love and memories.Tagpuan is a Filipino term which means, “a place to meet agreed by two or more people.” In other words, rendezvous, and this is one of the concepts made by Love Union – a consulting company which aims to help other businesses find a niche of their own; and it was a success! </p>

			<h2> EL UNION COFFEE </h2>
			<hr>
			<p> El Union Coffee, a laidback and hip café found along the highway of San Juan, is a favorite destination for anyone’s much-needed caffeine fix. Upon entering their charming little spot, you’d feel that it’s very cozy, much like you’re in a boho-themed café without the usual restaurant setup you’d find in Manila. It’s a relaxing casual spot which can accommodate just about 10 to 20 persons at a time, making it a bit more intimate. It’s a place where you can meet new friends over good coffee, or you can also enjoy your cup alone.</p>

			<h2> FLOTSAM AND JETSAM </h2>
			<hr>
			<p>Flotsam and Jetsam Hostel in San Juan, La Union offers a great place to unwind and stay in the surfing capital of northern Philippines. With its summery vibe and chill atmosphere, Flotsam and Jetsam surely provides a unique tropical experience.What’s riveting about this Flotsam and Jetsam hostel is the design. Some people might say it’s purely hipster, but in my view it is peculiar and unique. In the reception area, there were mini-sized illustration boards hanged on a wall displaying information of the weather and wave forecast jotted with colorful chalks. </p>
